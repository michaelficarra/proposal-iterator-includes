## motivation

This proposal has the same motivation as the original
[`Array.prototype.includes`
proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Array.prototype.includes). Just as
you do with Arrays, at times you need to ask whether an iterator would yield a
given value. And as with Arrays, you can use `some` with a custom comparator,
but that's not ideal because it doesn't as directly express your intent, and
each time you need to do that, you have the option of one of many comparison
operations, when that choice often doesn't matter. There should be a simple,
terse, standard way to look for something in the values yielded by an iterator.

## design questions

### comparison operation

There are at least 4 built-in comparison operations that somebody could want to
use for `includes`: strict equality (`===`), loose equality (`==`), SameValue
(`Object.is`), and SameValueZero (`Array.prototype.includes`). In a vacuum, we
could debate the merits of SameValue vs SameValueZero and which is best for
known popular use cases, but I don't think there's any argument that would be
stronger than choosing SameValueZero to match `Array.prototype.includes`.

### second parameter (fromIndex)

`Array.prototype.includes` has a second parameter that starts the search from
the given index instead of the beginning of the Array. This makes sense for the
Array API because the alternative (slicing first) would first allocate another
Array and then perform a copy from that index. Iterators have `drop`, so it's
unnecessary to include this parameter, but to avoid confusion for somebody who
is already familiar with the Array method, we choose to include it.
Unfortunately, there is still a difference in the interfaces because the
Iterator method cannot accept negative offsets, which would be a surprising
difference, but one that makes sense in context. Alternatively, we could throw
if a second argument is ever provided, but that would be a highly unusual
behaviour among JavaScript built-ins.

## chosen solution

A new `Iterator.prototype` method named `includes`.

```js
function* gen() { yield 1; yield 3; };
gen().includes(1); // true
gen().includes(2); // false
gen().includes(3); // true

gen().drop(1).includes(1); // false
gen().drop(1).includes(3); // true
gen().drop(2).includes(3); // false
```
